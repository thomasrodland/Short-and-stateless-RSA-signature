 # Short-and-stateless-RSA-signature
 A Python implementation based on the short and stateless signature provided by Susan Hohenberger and Brent Waters
 in their paper Short and Stateless Signatures from the RSA Assumption https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/283. Their proposed chameleon hash is switched out with a different one. This is just for educational purposes and should not be used as a way to sign anything.
